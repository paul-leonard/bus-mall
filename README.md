### About Paul Leonard

#### Summary of Website
This is a website for a fictional company called BusMall.  The premise is to create a web app that BusMall can use in marketing research to determine which products should be included and/or featured in their magizine.  The app shows three random products to the survey user.  The user then clicks on their favorite of the three products.  The app tracks how many times each item is clicked on and the total amount of times a given product was shown.  From this, the interest in the product will be deduced and data displayed.  The underlying intent of this website is to practice creating a website that requires HTML, CSS, and JS.

## About Me (within a README for a website about me)
Thank you for visiting my page of notes.  I hope they were helpful to you.  Please also check out [my GitHub portfolio page](https://github.com/paul-leonard "Paul's GitHub Portfolio").

After graduating with a mechanical engineering degree from *Missouri University of Science and Technology* 13 years ago, I moved out to Seattle and started work at Boeing.  While there, I worked in airplane modifications, flight test, and flight controls design engineering.  I am super excited to return to a rich learning environment and gain some new programming skills.  I plan to complete the full course path ending with a specialty in Python.  I enjoy spending time outside by camping and hiking or having a beer at a brewery with friends (when that is a thing again).
